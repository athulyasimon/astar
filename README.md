#A* Implementation

A* is a search algorithm commonly used for path finding around obstacles. The implementation of this algorithm was an assignment for our ME449-Robotic Manipulation class.

The planner takes in the following inputs and returns a graph diplaying the available path (if there is one)
* robot radius
* radii and coordinates of obstacles
* coordinates of potential nodes
* coordinates of start and goal nodes
